    <h1>About the Developer</h1>
    <h2>üëã Hi There! I'm Kathryn Burkhart</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a student developer passionate about creating engaging, interactive web experiences.
      I built the <strong>Heels and Sneaks</strong> website as a fictional shoe store project for ISM 6225 App Dev for Analytics to demonstrate my skills in front-end web development.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Anywho, I am a graduate student at the University of South Florida, pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics. 
        I have recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Information Science from USF, graduating summa cum laude and received the university's highest academic 
        honor as a King O'Neal Scholar for maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>

    <p>
        My academic background blends data science, computer science, and business analytics, with a strong technical toolkit that includes Python, R, SQL, Tableau, 
        and other industry-standard tools. My interests lie in applying data-driven approaches to real-world challenges, particularly at the intersection of technology, healthcare, and business innovation.</p>

    <p>
        During my studies, I have contributed to a range of analytics and machine learning projects, and bring a collaborative, thoughtful approach to communicating insights and solving problems. 
        I am especially passionate about making data more accessible and actionable across sectors.</p>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Development Experience</h2>
    <p>
      This website was developed using standard web technologies including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML</strong> for semantic page structure</li>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong> for styling and responsive layout</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity and dynamic content</li>
      <li><strong>Chart.js</strong> for data visualization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The site includes pages for product display, inventory management (CRUD functionality), analytics dashboards, and more. I used modular code organization, folder structures (`css/`, `js/`, `img/`), and event-driven JavaScript to manage user interaction and product data.
    </p>

    <h2>üåê Webpage Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <li><strong>index.html</strong> acts as the shoe store's home page providing links to relevant pages such as Products
      and Gallery.</li>
      <li><strong>inventory.html</strong> demonstrates the usage of CRUD operations. Users can add or delete products
      as well as edit product entries.</li>
      <li><strong>analytics.html</strong> contains various visualizations regarding monthly sales trends, total units sold
      per product, and total revenue per product. The data visualizations are made using Chart.js and the data is read in via
    analytics.js.</li>
    </p>

    <h3>üëüüõí Bonus Pages to Mimic an Online Shoe Store</h3>
    <li><strong>shoppingcart.html</strong> attempts to give users the experience of adding and deleting items
    from the shopping cart.</li>
    <li><strong>slideshow.html</strong> gives users a preview of the upcoming summer shoe collection.</li>
